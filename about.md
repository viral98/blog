My work straddles around webRTC, noise reduction, and everything to do with audio over the web. I also have experience in writing lightweight electron applications, with OS-specific modifications.

I have stood top 3 in multiple hackathons across the country and have managed to participate in a couple of international ones. I am passionate about building solutions that solve real-world challenges. Through my research and internship projects, I have strived to build solutions that help society.
